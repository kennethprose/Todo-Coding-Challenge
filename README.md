## Tools Used

-   Frontend: React
-   Backend: Spring Boot
-   Database: MySQL

## How to run

1. Get a MySQL server running. I downloaded it from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html)
2. Create a database in the MySQL server. I called mine nuarch_todo
3. Open the Spring Boot folder in your IDE. I used IntelliJ.
4. Modify the contents of the Spring Boot application.properties file. Make sure the URL points to your SQL server and add the username and password for the server.
5. Run the Spring Boot application by running the TodoApplication.java file.
6. In the /frontend/todo directory, run the command 'npm start' to run the frontend of the project.
